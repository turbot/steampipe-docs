## Examples
List installed mods:
```bash
steampipe mod list
```

Install a mod and add the `require` statement to your `mod.sp`:
```bash
steampipe mod install github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-aws-compliance
```

Install an exact version of a mod and update the `require` statement to your `mod.sp`.  This may upgrade or downgrade the mod if it is already installed:
```bash
steampipe mod install github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-aws-compliance@0.1
```

Install a version of a mod using a semver constraint and update the `require` statement to your `mod.sp`.  This may upgrade or downgrade the mod if it is already installed:
```bash
steampipe mod install github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-aws-compliance@'^1'
```

Install all mods specified in the `mod.sp` and their dependencies:
```bash
steampipe mod install
```

Preview what `steampipe mod install` will do, without actually installing anything:
```bash
steampipe mod install --dry-run
```


Update a mod to the latest version allowed by its current constraint:
```bash
steampipe mod update github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-aws-compliance
```

Update all mods specified in the `mod.sp` and their dependencies to the latest versions that meet their constraints, and install any that are missing:
```bash
steampipe mod update
```


Uninstall a mod:
```bash
steampipe mod uninstall github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-azure-compliance
```

Preview uninstalling a mod, but don't uninstall it:
```bash

```
