# steampipe login
Log in to [Steampipe Cloud](/docs/cloud/overview).

The Steampipe CLI can interact with Steampipe Cloud to run queries, benchmarks, and dashboards against a remote cloud database, and to save and share snapshots. These capabilities require authenticating to Steampipe Cloud.  The `steampipe login` command launches an interactive process for logging in and obtaining a temporary (30 day) token. The token is written to `~/.steampipe/internal/{cloud host}.sptt`.

## Usage
```bash
steampipe login
```

## Examples

Login to `cloud.steampipe.io`:

```bash
steampipe login
```


The `steampipe login` command will launch your web browser to continue the login process. Verify the request.

After you have verified the request, the browser will display a verification code.
