# graph

A graph is a dashboard component that allows you to visualize the relationships between different resources and understand how they are connected.

Graphs can be declared as a block inside a dashboard or container. The data to be displayed in the graph is specified using a series of nodes and edges. The nodes  define the vertices of the graph, and the edges define the connections between them.

## Example Usage

```hcl
dashboard "tables" {

  graph {
    title = "Schemas & Tables"

    node {
      category = category.catalog

      sql = <<-EOQ
        select
          distinct on (catalog_name)
          concat('catalog:',catalog_name) as id,
          catalog_name as title
        from
          information_schema.schemata
       where
          schema_name = 'net'
      EOQ
    }

    node {
      category = category.schema
      sql = <<-EOQ
        select
          concat('schema:',schema_name) as id,
          schema_name as title,
          json_build_object(
            'catalog', catalog_name,
            'schema', schema_name,
            'owner', schema_owner
          ) as properties
        from
          information_schema.schemata
        where
          schema_name = 'net'

## Node/Edge Visualizations

Some steampipe dashboard elements can include `node` and `edge` blocks.  These elements are sometimes referred to as **node/edge visualizations** and include `graph`, `flow`, and `hierarchy`. These resources essentially implement the same interface:
  - They support `node` and `edge` blocks as children
  - They are also [query-based resources](/docs/reference/mod-resources/query#query-based-resources), and support using the `sql` and `query` arguments instead of `node` and `edge` blocks
  - They must appear in a dashboard to be displayed, but may be defined as top level resources and referenced with `base`
  - They support `param` and `with` blocks, but only when in a top level resource
  - They support `category` blocks
  - They have similar data formats


### Monolithic Query v/s Node & Edge Blocks

Node/edge visualizations allow you to specify a monolithic query that returns a row for each node and edge, or you can specify `node` and `edge` blocks to define the nodes and edges separately.

In either case, the concept of *nodes* and *edges* is the same.  *Nodes* and *edges* represent points and connections in a `graph`, `hierarchy` or `flow`.  A *node* is a vertex in the diagram, whereas as an *edge* is a relationship between 2 nodes (usually represented with a line connecting them).

Key differences between nodes and edges are:
- A `node` MUST have an `id`.  An `edge` CANNOT have an `id`.
- An `edge` must have a `from_id` and a `to_id`. A `node` CANNOT have a `to_id`.  Nodes USUALLY do not have a `from_id` either, however for simple single-parent hierarchies it is often simpler to create a simple edge by specifying `from_id` on the `node` instead of creating separate node and edge blocks / rows.


#### Node & Edge Blocks
Typically, it is preferable to specify `node` and `edge` blocks than to use the monolithic query format:
- Using `node` and `edge` results in simpler, more readable, maintainable configuration.
- Developing large union queries is difficult. Errors are hard to find and fix.  The `node` and `edge` model provides smaller, simpler queries that can be run and tested independently.
- You can reuse nodes and edges in multiple node/edge visualizations.
- Steampipe can run the node/edge queries in parallel, and can provide better status information while the visualization is loading.

In the node / edge model, your `graph`, `flow`, or `hierarchy` block will not specify the `sql` or `query` argument, but instead will contain one or more `node` blocks and `edge` blocks.  The `node` and `edge` blocks will specify the `sql` or `query` argument to retrieve the data for the node or edge.

The sql column names are identical to the monolithic query format.  Note that some fields (`category`, `title`) may be specified in HCL *or* in the query results.  When *both* are specified, the SQL value takes precedence.


##### Example: Graph with node/edge blocks

```hcl
dashboard "plugin_versions" {

  graph {
    title = "LDAP Plugin Versions"

    node {
      category = category.plugin

      sql = <<-EOQ
        select
          name as id,
          name as title,
          jsonb_build_object(
            'name', name,
            'created', create_time,
            'updated', update_time
          ) as properties
        from
          steampipe_registry_plugin
       where
          name = 'turbot/ldap'
      EOQ
    }

    node {
      category = category.plugin_version

      sql = <<-EOQ
        select
          digest as id,
          left(split_part(digest,':',2),12) as title,
          jsonb_build_object(
            'digest', digest,
            'created', create_time,
            'updated', update_time
          ) as properties
        from
          steampipe_registry_plugin_version
       where
          name = 'turbot/ldap'
      EOQ
    }

    node {
      category = category.plugin_tag

      sql = <<-EOQ
        select
          concat(digest,':',tag) as id,
          tag as title
        from
          steampipe_registry_plugin_version,
          jsonb_array_elements(tags) as tag
       where
          name = 'turbot/ldap'
      EOQ
    }

    edge {
      title = "version"

      sql = <<-EOQ
        select
          name as from_id,
          digest as to_id
        from
          steampipe_registry_plugin_version
        where
          name = 'turbot/ldap'
      EOQ
    }


    edge {
      title = "tag"

      sql = <<-EOQ
        select
          digest as from_id,
          concat(digest,':',tag) as to_id
        from
          steampipe_registry_plugin_version,
          jsonb_array_elements(tags) as tag
       where
          name = 'turbot/ldap'
      EOQ
    }

  }
}


category "plugin" {
  title = "plugin"
  icon  = "extension"
  color = "darkred"
}

category "plugin_version" {
  title = "version"
  icon  = "difference"
  color = "darkred"
}

category "plugin_tag" {
  title = "tag"
  icon  = "sell"
  color = "black"
}
```

Including the full node and edge block definitions within the graph can become unwieldy as the graph becomes more complex.  It is often preferable to define the node and edge blocks as top-level resources and include them in the graph with the `base` argument.  This allows you to reuse the nodes and edges in multiple node/edge visualizations.  You can even define parameters in the nodes and edges, and pass arguments from the graph.

```hcl

dashboard "plugin_versions_example" {

  input "plugin_name" {
    query   = query.plugin_input
    width  = 4
  }

  graph {
    title = "Plugin Versions"

    node {
      base = node.plugin
      args = {
        plugin_name = self.input.plugin_name.value
      }
    }

    node {
      base = node.plugin_version
      args = {
        plugin_name = self.input.plugin_name.value
      }
    }

    node {
      base = node.plugin_tag
      args = {
        plugin_name = self.input.plugin_name.value
      }
    }

    edge {
      base = edge.plugin_to_version
      args = {
        plugin_name = self.input.plugin_name.value
      }
    }

    edge {
      base = edge.version_to_tag
      args = {
        plugin_name = self.input.plugin_name.value
      }
    }

  }
}

query "plugin_input" {
  sql = <<-EOQ
    select
      name as value,
      name as label
    from
      steampipe_registry_plugin
  EOQ
}

node "plugin"{
  category = category.plugin

  sql = <<-EOQ
    select
      name as id,
      name as title,
      json_build_object(
        'name', name,
        'created', create_time,
        'updated', update_time
      ) as properties
    from
      steampipe_registry_plugin
    where
      name = $1
  EOQ

  param "plugin_name" {}
}

node "plugin_version" {
  category = category.plugin_version

  sql = <<-EOQ

  icon  = "difference"
  color = "darkred"
}

category "plugin_tag" {

  icon  = "sell"
  color = "black"
}
```



#### Monolithic query

Node/edge visualizations are also query-based resources, and support using either the `sql` or `query` argument (but not both).  When using a monolithic query, the query must return a row for each node and edge.  Note that using a single query is an older format - generally it is simpler to use `node` and `edge` blocks instead.


Significant columns are:

| Name       | Applies To | Description
|------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------
| `id`       | node       | A unique identifier for the node.  Nodes have an `id`, edges do not.  `id` is required for nodes.
| `title`    | node, edge | A title to display for the node.
| `category` | node, edge | A display category.  This can be a `category` block or a reference to a named `category`.
| `depth`    | node  (`flow` only)    | An integer to set the position of the node in a flow. The layout of the nodes is inferred from the query, however you can force placement with the `depth` column if you need to override the default behavior.
| `from_id`  | node, edge | The `id` of the source side of an edge. `from_id` is required for edges, optional for nodes.
| `properties`| node, edge (graph only) | A jsonb key/value map of properties to display for the node/edge when the user hovers over it.  The `properties` column is optional for nodes and edges.
| `to_id`    | edge       | The `id` of the destination side of an edge. `to_id` is required for edges.

Typically, the monolithic query will be a large `union` query. Note that both column *names* and their *relative position* are important! Steampipe looks for columns *by name* in the result set, however Postgres union queries will *append the rows based on the column's position*, not the name of the column.  ***All the `union` queries must return the same columns, in the same order.***


Most commonly, you should specify nodes and edges as separate rows.  In this case, nodes will have an `id` and optionally `title`, `category`, and/or `depth`, but `to_id` and `from_id` will be null.  Edges will populate `to_id` and `from_id` and optionally `category`, and will have null `id`, `depth`, and `title`:


| from_id | to_id     | id               | title            | category         |
|---------|-----------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| <null\> |  <null\>  | 1                | foo              | root             |
| <null\> |  <null\>  | 2                | bar              | widget           |
| <null\> |  <null\>  | 3                | baz              | widget           |
| <null\> |  <null\>  | 4                | foobar           | fidget           |
| 1       |  2        |  <null\>         | <null\>          | widget           |
| 1       |  3        |  <null\>         | <null\>          | widget           |
| 2       |  4        |  <null\>         | <null\>          | fidget           |
| 3       |  4        |  <null\>         | <null\>          | fidget           |


If the data is strictly hierarchical (where each node can only have a single parent, as for a `hierarchy`), it may be simpler to format the results such that each row species a node (with an `id`, and optionally `title`, `category`, and/or `depth`) and an edge, by specifying a `from_id`:

| from_id | id               | title            | category         |
|---------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| <null\> | 1                | foo              | root             |
| 1       | 2                | bar              | widget           |
| 1       | 3                | baz              | widget           |
| 2       | 4                | foobar           | fidget           |

### Categories

Node/Edge visualizations allow you to specify a [category](/docs/reference/mod-resources/category) for each node and edge.  Categories are used to define display properties such as color, title, and icon to provide a consistent look and feel across panels and dashboards.

Categories may be defined either at the mod level or in a `graph`, `flow`, or `hierarchy`.  When using `node` and `edge` blocks, it is typically preferable to define the categories as top-level, named mod resources.  This allows you to reference them via the `category` HCL argument in a node or edge.  When specifying a `category` column in SQL, such as when using the monolithic query approach, you will need to define the category in the graph, flow, or hierarchy.

### With blocks

Node/Edge visualizations support [`with` blocks](/docs/reference/mod-resources/with). Similar to a `with` clause in a postgres CTE, the `with` block allows you to specify additional queries or SQL statements to run **first**, and then pass the query results as arguments to `sql`, `query`, and `node` & `edge` blocks.

You can only specify `with` blocks on **top-level named resources** in your mod. The results of the `with` query can be referenced only within the resource in which it is defined (including any sub-blocks).
