# flow

A flow allows visualization of queries using types such as `sankey`.  Flows are [node/edge visualizations](/docs/reference/mod-resources/graph#nodeedge-visualizations).  The data to be displayed is specified using a series of nodes and edges. The nodes define the vertices of the graph, and the edges define the connections between them.

Flow blocks can be declared as named resources at the top level of a mod, or can be declared as anonymous blocks inside a `dashboard` or `container`, or be re-used inside a `dashboard` or `container` by using a `flow` with `base = <mod>.flow.<flow_resource_name>`.

    width = 4

    sql = <<-EOQ
      select

## Argument Reference
| Argument | Type | Optional? | Description
|-|-|-|-
| `args` | Map | Optional| A map of arguments to pass to the query. 
| `base` |  flow Reference		| Optional | A reference to a named `flow` resource that this `flow` should source its definition from. `title` and `width` can be overridden after sourcing via `base`.
| `category` | Block | Optional| [category](#category) blocks that specify display options for nodes with that category.
| `edge` | Block | Optional| [edge](/docs/reference/mod-resources/edge) blocks that define the edges in the flow.
| `node` | Block | Optional| [node](/docs/reference/mod-resources/node) blocks that define the nodes in the flow.
| `param` | Block | Optional| [param](reference/mod-resources/query#param) blocks that defines the parameters that can be passed in to the query.  `param` blocks may only be specified for hierarchies that specify the `sql` argument. 
| `query` | Query Reference | Optional | A reference to a [query](reference/mod-resources/query) resource that defines the query to run.  A `flow`  may either specify the `query` argument or the `sql` argument, but not both.
| `sql` |  String	| Optional |  An SQL string to provide data for the `flow`.  A `flow` may either specify the `query` argument or the `sql` argument, but not both.
| `title` |  String	| Optional | A plain text [title](/docs/reference/mod-resources/dashboard#title) to display for this flow.
| `type` |  String	| Optional | The type of the flow. Can be `sankey` or `table`.
| `width` |  Number	| Optional | The [width](/docs/reference/mod-resources/dashboard#width) as a number of grid units that this item should consume from its parent.
| `with` | Block | Optional| [with](/docs/reference/mod-resources/with) blocks that define prerequisite queries to run.  `with` blocks may only be specified when the flow is defined as a top-level (mod level), named resource.




## Common Flow Properties

### category

| Property | Type   | Default                                                              | Values                                                                                                                                  | Description |
| -------- | ------ |----------------------------------------------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `color`  | string | The matching color from the default theme for the data series index. | A [valid color value](reference/mod-resources/dashboard#color).  This may be a named color, RGB or RGBA string, or a control status color. |  The color to display for this category.           |



## Data Format
Flow data must be provided in a format where each row represents a *node* (vertex), an *edge* (connecting 2 vertices), or both. 

Note that both column *names* and their *relative position* are important in flow queries; Steampipe looks for columns *by name* in the result set, however Postgres union queries will *append the rows based on the column's position*, not the name of the column.  ***All the `union` queries must return the same columns, in the same order.***

Significant columns  are:

| Name       | Description
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------
| `id`       | A unique identifier for the node.  Nodes have an `id`, edges do not.
| `title`    | A title to display for the node.
| `category` | A display category name. Both nodes and edges may specify a `category` to dictate how the item is displayed.  By default, items of the same category are displayed with the same appearance (color), distinct from other categories.  You can specify display options with a [category](#category) block.
| `depth`    | An integer to set the position of the node. The layout of the nodes is inferred from the query, however you can force placement with the `depth` column if you need to override the default behavior.
| `from_id`  | The `id` of the source side of an edge.
| `to_id`    | The `id` of the destination side of an edge.




Generally speaking, there are 2 data formats commonly used for flows.  If the data is hierarchical, it is often simpler to specify results where each row species a node (with an `id`, and optionally `title`, `category`, and/or `depth`) and an edge, by specifying a `from_id`:  

| from_id | id               | title            | category         |
|---------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| <null\> | 1                | foo              | root             |
| 1       | 2                | bar              | widget           |
| 1       | 3                | baz              | widget           |
| 2       | 4                | foobar           | fidget           |

For flows that do not conform to a single-parent hierarchical structure, its usually easier to specify nodes and edges as separate rows.  In this case, nodes will have an `id` and optionally `title`, `category`, and/or `depth`, but `to_id` and `from_id` will be null.  Edges will populate `to_id` and `from_id` and optionally `category`, and will have null `id`, `depth`, and `title`:


| from_id | to_id     | id               | title            | category         |
|---------|-----------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| <null\> |  <null\>  | 1                | foo              | root             |
| <null\> |  <null\>  | 2                | bar              | widget           |
| <null\> |  <null\>  | 3                | baz              | widget           |
| <null\> |  <null\>  | 4                | foobar           | fidget           |
| 1       |  2        |  <null\>         | <null\>          | widget           |
| 1       |  3        |  <null\>         | <null\>          | widget           |
| 2       |  4        |  <null\>         | <null\>          | fidget           |
| 3       |  4        |  <null\>         | <null\>          | fidget           |
