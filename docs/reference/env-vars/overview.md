# Environment Variables

Steampipe supports environment variables to allow you to change its default behavior.  These are optional settings - You are not required to set any environment variables.

Note that plugins may also support environment variables, but these are plugin-specific - refer to your plugin's documentation on the hub.steampipe.io for details.
