# STEAMPIPE_CLOUD_TOKEN
Sets the [Steampipe Cloud authentication token](/docs/cloud/profile#tokens). This is used when connecting to Steampipe Cloud workspaces.  

By default, Steampipe will use the token obtained by running `steampipe login`, but you may also set this to user-generated [API token](/docs/cloud/profile#tokens).  You can manage your API tokens from the **Settings** page for your user account in Steampipe Cloud.

## Usage 
Set your api token:
```bash
export STEAMPIPE_CLOUD_TOKEN=spt_c6f5tmpe4mv9appio5rg_3jz0a8fakekeyf8ng72qr646
```
