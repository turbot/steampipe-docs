# workspace 

A Steampipe `workspace` is a "profile" that allows you to define a unified environment 
that the Steampipe client can interact with.  Each workspace is composed of:
- a single Steampipe database instance
- a single mod directory (which may also contain [dependency mods](/docs/mods/mod-dependencies#mod-dependencies))
- context-specific settings and options  (snapshot location, query timeout, etc)

Steampipe workspaces allow you to define multiple named configurations and easily switch between them using the `--workspace` argument or `STEAMPIPE_WORKSPACE` 
environment variable.

## Supported options  

| Argument            |    Default  | Description
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
| `base`              | none                                          | A reference to a named workspace resource that this workspace should source its definition from. Any argument can be overridden after sourcing via base.
| `cloud_host`        | `cloud.steampipe.io`                          | Set the Steampipe Cloud host for connecting to Steampipe Cloud workspace.
| `cloud_token`       | The token obtained by `steampipe login`       | Set the Steampipe Cloud authentication token for connecting to a Steampipe Cloud workspace.  This may be a token obtained by `steampipe login` or a user-generated [token](/docs/cloud/profile#tokens).
| `install_dir`       | `~/.steampipe`                                | The directory in which the Steampipe database, plugins, and supporting files can be found.
| `mod_location`      | The current working directory                 | Set the workspace working directory.
| `query_timeout`     | `240` for controls, unlimited otherwise       | The maximum time (in seconds) a query is allowed to run before it times out.
| `snapshot_location` | The Steampipe Cloud user's personal workspace | Set the Steampipe Cloud workspace or filesystem path for writing snapshots.
| `workspace_database`| `local`                                       | Workspace database. This can be local or a remote Steampipe Cloud database.


<!--

| `search_path`       | `public`, then alphabetical                   | A comma-separated list of connections to use as a custom search path for the control run. See also: [Using search_path to target connections and aggregators](https://steampipe.io/docs/guides/search-path).
| `search_path_prefix`| none                                          | A comma-separated list of connections to use as a prefix to the current search path for the control run. 
| `watch`             | `true`                                        | Watch .sql and .sp files in the current workspace (works only in interactive mode).



| `max_parallel`      | 5                                             | Set the maximum number of parallel executions. When running steampipe check, Steampipe will attempt to run up to this many controls in parallel.


| `options`            | none                                          | An options block to set command-specific options for this workspace.   Only `query` and `check` options are supported.
