# Cloud Shells

Cloud Shells are browser-based terminals in which you can install Steampipe and run queries against the resources provided by AWS, Azure, GCP, or other clouds. Because they typically launch with the cloud provider's CLI already installed -- and configured with your credentials -- Cloud Shells can be the fastest and easiest way to query your cloud resources with Steampipe.
