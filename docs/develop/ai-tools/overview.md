# AI Tools

To help with developing new plugins and tables, we've created several prompts to help speed up development by providing helpful guidelines and examples.

We recommend using multiple prompts to break down the work and allow specific context to be passed in at each step.

You can use each prompt below in one of several ways:
- Use the prompt directly
- Include the file in your prompt with [Cursor @Files](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/@-files) 
- Add it to rules, like [Cursor rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules) or [Windsurf rules](https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/cascade/memories#rules)

We also recommend installing the [Steampipe MCP server](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mcp) to help test running queries for your new table.
