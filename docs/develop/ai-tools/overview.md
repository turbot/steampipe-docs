# AI Tools

To help with developing new plugins and tables, we've created several prompts to help speed up development by providing helpful guidelines and examples.

You can use each prompt below in one of several ways:
- Use the prompt directly
- Add them to your prompt context as files, e.g., [Cursor @Files](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/@-files)
- Add them to your rules or instructions, e.g., [Cursor rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules), [VS Code instructions or prompt files](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization), [Windsurf rules](https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/cascade/memories#rules)

We also recommend installing the [Steampipe MCP server](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mcp) to help test running queries for your new table.
