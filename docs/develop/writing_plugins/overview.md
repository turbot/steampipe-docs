# Writing Plugins

The <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-sdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steampipe Plugin SDK</a> makes writing tables fast, easy, and fun!  Most of the heavy lifting is taken care of for you â€” just define your tables and columns, wire up a few API calls, and you can start to query your service with standard SQL!

While this documentation will provide an introduction and some examples, note that Steampipe is an evolving, open source project. Please refer to the code as the authoritative source, as well as for real-world examples.

Also, please try to be a good community citizen. Following the <a href="/docs/develop/standards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standards</a> makes for a better, more consistent experience for end-users and developers alike.
