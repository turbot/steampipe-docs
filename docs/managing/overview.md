# Manage Steampipe

Steampipe is simple to install and manage and does not require any special expertise to get started.  You will need to [install and update plugins](/docs/managing/plugins) and [manage connections](/docs/managing/connections), but any other configuration is optional.

If you wish, you may [run Steampipe as a local service](/docs/managing/service), exposing the database endpoint for connection from any Postgres-compatible database client.
