# Learn Steampipe

Steampipe provides zero-ETL tools for fetching data directly from APIs and services.  Steampipe is offered in several distributions:
- The **Steampipe CLI** exposes APIs and services as a high-performance relational database, enabling you to write SQL-based queries to explore dynamic data. The Steampipe CLI is a turnkey solution that includes its own PostgreSQL database including plugin management.
- **[Steampipe Postgres FDWs](/docs/steampipe_postgres/overview)** are native Postgres Foreign Data Wrappers that translate APIs to foreign tables.  Unlike Steampipe CLI, which ships with its own Postgres server instance, the Steampipe Postgres FDWs can be installed in any supported Postgres database version.
- **[Steampipe SQLite Extensions](/docs/steampipe_sqlite/overview)** provide SQLite virtual tables that translate your queries into API calls, transparently fetching information from your API or service as you request it.
- **[Steampipe Export CLIs](/docs/steampipe_export/overview)** provide a flexible mechanism for exporting information from cloud services and APIs.  Each exporter is a stand-alone binary that allows you to extract data using Steampipe plugins *without a database*.
- **[Turbot Pipes](/docs/steampipe-cloud)** is the only intelligence, automation & security platform built specifically for DevOps. Pipes provides hosted Steampipe database instances, shared dashboards, snapshots, and more!


This tutorial uses the Steampipe CLI.   Let's dive in...

## Install the AWS plugin

This tutorial uses the [AWS plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws). To get started, [download and install Steampipe](/downloads), and then install the plugin:

```bash
steampipe plugin install aws
```

Steampipe will download and install additional components the first time you run `steampipe query` so it may take a few seconds to load initially.

Out of the box, Steampipe will use your default AWS credentials from your credential file and/or environment variables, so you'll need to make sure those are set up as well.  If you can run `aws ec2 describe-vpcs`, you're good to go.  (The AWS plugin provides additional examples to [configure your credentials](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws#configuring-aws-credentials), and even configure steampipe to query [multiple accounts](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws#multi-account-connections) and [multiple regions](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws#multi-region-connections
).)




## Explore
Steampipe provides commands that allow you to discover and explore the tables and data without leaving the query shell.  (Of course, this information is all available in [the hub](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws/tables) if online docs are more your speed...)

Let's fire up Steampipe!  Run `steampipe query` to open an interactive query session:

```bash
$ steampipe query
Welcome to Steampipe v0.5.0
For more information, type .help
>

```

Now run the `.tables` meta-command to list the available tables:

```
> .tables
==> aws
+----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| table                                  | description                                 |
+----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| aws_accessanalyzer_analyzer            | AWS Access Analyzer                         |
| aws_account                            | AWS Account                                 |
| aws_acm_certificate                    | AWS ACM Certificate                         |
| aws_api_gateway_api_key                | AWS API Gateway API Key                     |
...
+----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
```

As you can see, there are quite a few tables available in the AWS plugin!

It looks like there's an `aws_iam_role` table - let's run `.inspect` to see what's in that table:
```
> .inspect aws_iam_role

+---------------------------+-----------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


## Query

Now that we know what columns are available in the `aws_iam_role` table, let's run a simple query to list the roles:

```sql
 select name from aws_iam_role
```

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| name                                                             |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations                                   |
| aws-elasticbeanstalk-service-role                                |
| admin                                                            |
| AWSServiceRoleForAmazonElasticsearchService                      |
| user                                                             |
| AWSServiceRoleForAccessAnalyzer                                  |
| CLoudtrailRoleForCloudwatchLogs                                  |
| aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role                                    |
| rds_metadata                                                     |
| metadata                                                         |
| AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling                                     |
| operator                                                         |
| s3crr_role_for_vanedaly-replicated-bucket-01_to_test-repl-dest-f |
| iam_owner                                                        |
| ec2_owner                                                        |
| ec2_operator                                                     |
| AWSServiceRoleForSSO                                             |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+

```

Now let's ask a more interesting question.  Let's find roles that have no boundary policy applied:

```sql
select
  name
from
  aws_iam_role
where
  permissions_boundary_arn is null;
```

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| name                                                             |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations                                   |
| aws-elasticbeanstalk-service-role                                |
| AWSServiceRoleForAmazonElasticsearchService                      |
| AWSServiceRoleForAccessAnalyzer                                  |
| CLoudtrailRoleForCloudwatchLogs                                  |
| aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role                                    |
| AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling                                     |
| s3crr_role_for_vanedaly-replicated-bucket-01_to_test-repl-dest-f |
| AWSServiceRoleForSSO                                             |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+

```

Like any database, we can join tables together as well.  For instance, we can find all the roles that have AWS-managed policies attached:
```sql
select
  r.name,
  policy_arn,
  p.is_aws_managed
from
  aws_iam_role as r,
  jsonb_array_elements_text(attached_policy_arns) as policy_arn,
  aws_iam_policy as p
where
  p.arn = policy_arn
  and p.is_aws_managed;

```

```
+-------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------+

| admin                                                 | arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess                                             | true           |
| AWSServiceRoleForSSO                                  | arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/aws-service-role/AWSSSOServiceRolePolicy                   | true           |

| AWSServiceRoleForElasticLoadBalancing                 | arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/aws-service-role/AWSElasticLoadBalancingServiceRolePolicy  | true           |
| aws-elasticbeanstalk-service-role                     | arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSElasticBeanstalkService                    | true           |
