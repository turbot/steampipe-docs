# Authenticate to AWS with OIDC

If you run Steampipe in a [GitHub Action](https://steampipe.io/docs/integrations/github_actions/installing_steampipe) you can use GitHub Actions Secrets to store the credentials that Steampipe uses to access AWS, Azure, GCP, or another cloud API. But what if you don't want to persist credentials there? An alternative is to use OpenID Connect (OIDC) to enable an Actions workflow that acquires temporary credentials on demand.

The example shown in this post uses the OIDC method in a workflow that:

1. Installs Steampipe (along with a cloud-specific plugin and compliance mod).
2. Runs the Steampipe Compliance Mod for AWS and saves the output in the repository.

## What is OIDC?

[OpenID Connect 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) is an identity layer on top of the [OAuth 2.0 protocol](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749). It enables clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

## Define the workflow

First, we must create the GitHub Actions workflow file in your repository. For this [example](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-samples/blob/main/all/github-actions-oidc/aws/steampipe-sample-aws-workflow.yml) we will use the filename `.github/workflows/steampipe.yml`

### Triggers

GitHub supports a variety of event-driven triggers. Here we define two: `workflow_dispatch` to [manually run a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow) and `schedule` to run on a cron-like schedule. To trigger the `workflow_dispatch` event, your workflow must be in the default branch.

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 4 7,14,21,28 * *"
```

### Permissions

Every time your job runs, GitHub's OIDC Provider auto-generates an OIDC token. This token contains multiple claims to establish a security-hardened and verifiable identity about the workflow that is trying to authenticate. In order to request this OIDC JWT ID token, your job or workflow run requires a permissions setting with `id-token: write`.

In order to checkout to the GitHub repository and to save the benchmark results to the repository, your job or workflow run also requires a permissions setting with `contents: write`.

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: write
```

### Steps

A workflow comprises one or more jobs that run in parallel, each with one or more steps that run in order. Our [example](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-samples/blob/d1658920c41da9ff5a2b98ab981ad330f2ee34a8/all/github-actions-oidc/aws/steampipe-sample-aws-workflow.yml#L15) defines a single job with a series of steps that authenticate to AWS, install Steampipe, run a compliance benchmark and save the results to the repository.

First, create a step that configures the credentials Steampipe will use to access AWS.

```yaml
- name: "Configure AWS credentials"
  id: config-aws-auth
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1-node16
  with:
    role-to-assume: ${{ secrets.OIDC_AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME }}
    role-session-name: "steampipe-demo"
    role-duration-seconds: 900
    aws-region: "us-east-1"
```

Once the cloud provider successfully validates the claims presented in the OIDC JWT ID token, it then provides a short-lived access token that is available only for the duration of the job. The short-lived access token is exported as environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_SESSION_TOKEN.
Steampipe will load these short-lived [credentials from environment variables](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws#credentials-from-environment-variables) to run the benchmark.

Next, you'll need to create a step that installs the Steampipe CLI and AWS plugin.

```yaml
- name: "Install Steampipe CLI and AWS plugin"
  id: steampipe-installation
  uses: turbot/steampipe-action-setup@v1
  with:
      steampipe-version: 'latest'
      plugin-connections: |
        connection "aws" {
          plugin = "aws"
        }
```

Before running the compliance benchmark, create a new folder on the branch specified in your GitHub repository to save the benchmark output. In our example, we will save the outputs to the folder `steampipe/benchmarks/aws`. The default environment variable [GITHUB_WORKSPACE](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#default-environment-variables) refers to the default working directory on the runner for steps, and the default location of your repository when using the [checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action.

Next, create a step that installs the [AWS Compliance](https://hub.steampipe.io/mods/turbot/aws_compliance) mod and runs the AWS CIS v2.0.0 Benchmark.

```yaml
- name: "Run Steampipe benchmark"
  id: steampipe-benchmark
  continue-on-error: true
  run: |
    # Install the Steampipe AWS Compliance mod
    steampipe mod install github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-aws-compliance
    cd .steampipe/mods/github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-aws-compliance*
    # Run the AWS CIS v2.0.0 benchmark
    steampipe check benchmark.cis_v200 --export=$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/steampipe/benchmarks/aws/cis_v200_"$(date +"%d_%B_%Y")".html --output=none
```

Finally, add a step that pushes the output of the benchmark to your repository. Update the `working-directory` to the folder created in the above step. This should be the same location used in the above `--export` argument.

```yaml
- name: "Commit the file to GitHub"
  id: push-to-gh
  working-directory: steampipe/benchmarks/aws
  run: |
    git config user.name github-actions
    git config user.email github-actions@github.com
    git add cis_v200_"$(date +"%d_%B_%Y")".html
    git commit -m "Add Steampipe Benchmark Results"
    git push
```

## Configuring GitHub's OIDC provider for AWS

In order for AWS to trust GitHub, you must configure OIDC as an identity provider in your AWS account. GitHub's [Security hardening your deployments](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments) page has instructions for using OpenID Connect with various providers. If you prefer AWS CloudFormation, you can make use of this [link](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials#sample-iam-role-cloudformation-template) to get started. To help you follow those instructions we have created a [Terraform sample](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-samples/tree/main/all/github-actions-oidc/aws).

This guide will demonstrate the Terraform implementation. This Terraform script will create two AWS resources, an Identity provider and IAM Role in your account. These resources together form an OIDC trust between the AWS IAM role and your GitHub workflow(s) that need access to the cloud. In order to execute the Terraform code and deploy the resources GitHub needs, you will need local credentials for the target AWS account. This can be via AWS Identity Center, IAM User Access Keys, or via environment variables. Regardless of how you [authenticate](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#authentication-and-configuration), the permissions required to deploy the Terraform code must have permission to create IAM resources.

### Configuration

Update the `default.tfvars` file for the below variables.

* `github_repo`: GitHub repository that needs the access token. Example: octo-org/octo-repo
* `github_branch`: GitHub branch that runs the workflow. If you plan to trigger the workflow through schedule, then this must be the default branch. If you plan to run the workflow manually, this can be any branch. Example: master
* `aws_iam_role_name`: Name of the AWS IAM Role to create. Example: steampipe_gh_oidc_demo

### Implementation

Navigate to the folder where the [Terraform sample for AWS](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-samples/tree/main/all/github-actions-oidc/aws) is cloned. Run the below commands to create necessary resources in your AWS Account.

```bash
# Initialize Terraform to get all necessary providers.
terraform init

# Apply the configuration using the configuration file "defaults.tfvars"
terraform apply -var-file=default.tfvars
```

Successful execution of the above will give a Terraform output value of `OIDC_AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME`. This the ARN of the IAM role that handles the OIDC federation. Add `OIDC_AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME` and its value to the GitHub Secret in your repository as shown below.

<img alt="gh_secret" src="/images/docs/ci-cd-pipelines/oidc/gh_secret.png" />
</div>

### Validation

Login to your AWS account to verify that Terraform has created the following resources.

* AWS > IAM > Identity provider > token.actions.githubusercontent.com
* AWS > IAM > Role (rolename: steampipe_gh_oidc_demo)

The AWS IAM console should show the identity provider `token.actions.githubusercontent.com` as follows.
<div style={{"marginBottom":"2em","borderWidth":"thin", "borderStyle":"solid", "borderColor":"lightgray", "padding":"20px", "width":"90%"}}>
<img alt="aws_iam_identity_provider" src="/images/docs/ci-cd-pipelines/oidc/aws_iam_identity_provider.png" />
</div>

The IAM Role(steampipe_gh_oidc_demo) should show the following trust relationship.
<div style={{"marginBottom":"2em","borderWidth":"thin", "borderStyle":"solid", "borderColor":"lightgray", "padding":"20px", "width":"90%"}}>
<img alt="aws_iam_role" src="/images/docs/ci-cd-pipelines/oidc/aws_iam_role.png" />
</div>

## Running the workflow on-demand

The job will run on schedule, but it's always helpful to [run manually](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow) for sanity-check. Make sure you select the correct branch when executing this manually, this should be listed in the Trust Relationships of your IAM Role. (`github_branch` variable in the Terraform script).

<div style={{"marginBottom":"2em","borderWidth":"thin", "borderStyle":"solid", "borderColor":"lightgray", "padding":"20px", "width":"90%"}}>
<img alt="manual_run" src="/images/docs/ci-cd-pipelines/oidc/manual_run.png" />
</div>

Upon successful run of the GitHub action(schedule or manual run), the Steampipe benchmark result is automatically pushed to your GitHub repository.
