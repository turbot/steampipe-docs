# Integrations

Steampipe is easy to install and run on your laptop or server, but is also simple to setup and run it from a variety of [cloud shells](#cloud-shells) and [CI/CD tools](#cicd-pipelines)!


## Cloud Shells

Cloud Shells are browser-based terminals in which you can install Steampipe and run queries against the resources provided by AWS, Azure, GCP, or other clouds. Because they typically launch with the cloud provider's CLI already installed -- and configured with your credentials -- Cloud Shells can be the fastest and easiest way to query your cloud resources with Steampipe.

- [Google Cloud Shell](/docs/integrations/gcp_cloudshell)
- [Gitpod](/docs/integrations/gitpod)


## CI/CD Pipelines

CI/CD pipelines enable you to install and run your own tools, including Steampipe. The examples here show you how to install Steampipe in CI/CD pipelines, then install Steampipe plugins, then run queries.
