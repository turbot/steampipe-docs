# Take Snapshots

Steampipe allows you to take **snapshots**.  A snapshot is a saved view of a dashboard, query, or benchmark at a given point in time with a given set of inputs and variables.  All data and metadata for a snapshot is contained in a json file which can be saved and viewed locally in the Steampipe Dashboard or uploaded to [Steampipe Cloud](/docs/cloud/overview).  Snapshots in Steampipe Cloud may be shared with other Steampipe Cloud users or made public (shared with anyone that has the link).


You can create Steampipe Cloud snapshots directly from the Steampipe CLI, however if you wish to subsequently [modify](/docs/cloud/dashboards#managing-snapshots) them (add/remove tags, change visibility) or delete them, you must do so from the Steampipe Cloud console. You may [browse the snapshot list](/docs/cloud/dashboards#browsing-snapshots) in Steampipe Cloud by clicking the **Snapshots** button on the top of your workspace's **Dashboards** page.
