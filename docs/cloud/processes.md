## Processes

Whilst [pipelines](#pipelines) encapsulate the steps required to perform various workflows, each discrete step in a pipeline 
will be made up of at least one `process`. A process will show who initiated it and provide detailed logs of the output.

To view your processes, navigate to either your own identity or workspace `Activity`
tab and then to the `Processes` left-nav. Here you'll find a list of processes with a link to the detail for each.

If you click into a process in the list, you'll see the status, which user initiated it and where applicable, a link to the pipeline 
for it.

You'll also see detailed logs, with expandable and copyable data where available.
