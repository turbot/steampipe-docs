##  Connect to Steampipe Cloud from Azure Data Studio

[Azure Data Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/data-studio/) is a cross-platform database tool for data exploration and visualization that connects to many databases, including Postgres, and enables users to monitor, query, and visualize data.

Steampipe provides a single interface to all your cloud, code, logs and more. Because it's built on Postgres, Steampipe provides an endpoint that any Postgres-compatible client -- including Azure Data Studio -- can connect to.

The [Connect](/docs/cloud/integrations/overview) tab for your workspace provides the details you need to connect Azure Data Studio to Steampipe Cloud.

##  Connect to Steampipe CLI from Azure Data Studio

You can also connect Azure Data Studio to [Steampipe CLI](https://steampipe.io/downloads). To do that, run `steampipe service start --show-password` and use the displayed connection details.

```
Steampipe service is running:
Database:
  Host(s):            localhost, 127.0.0.1, 192.168.29.204
  Port:               9193
  Database:           steampipe
  User:               steampipe
  Password:           99**_****_**8c
  Connection string:  postgres://steampipe:99**_****_**8c@localhost:9193/steampipe
  ```

## Getting started

[Azure Data Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?view=sql-server-ver16) is available to use on the desktop. First let's create a Steampipe Cloud connection from Azure Data Studio, then chart Apple's hourly price history using the [Finance](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/finance) plugin.

To create a new connection, first install the [PostgreSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/sql/azure-data-studio/extensions/postgres-extension?view=sql-server-ver16) extension from the `Extensions` tab in the sidebar. Click on `New Connection` from the Connections tab, select PostgreSQL as the `Connection type` and add the connection details. Click `Advanced` and update the Port number and set the SSL mode to Require.

<img src="/images/docs/cloud/azure-datastudio-connection-success.png" />
</div>

Once the database is connected, you can load plugins and the tables from the navigation bar.

<div style={{"marginTop":"1em", "marginBottom":"1em", "width":"50%"}}>
<img src="/images/docs/cloud/azure-datastudio-navigatonbar.png" />
</div>

Now to create a chart, first right click on the database name, select `New Query` and paste this query.

```
select
  close
from
  finance_quote_hourly
where
  symbol = 'AAPL'
order by
  timestamp desc
```

Data studio previews the data in a table form. To convert it into a visual, click `Chart` from the sidebar and select `Chart Type` as Bar. The data can be saved in CSV, XML, JSON, Excel formats or as an Image.

<div style={{"marginTop":"1em", "marginBottom":"1em"}}>
<img src="/images/docs/cloud/azure-datastudio-appl-barchart.png" />
</div>

You can save the chart configuration and add it as a custom widget to display data in a dashboard. To do that, click `Create Insight` under the Chart tab and save the code displayed in a JSON format.

```json
{
    "name": "Apple hourly price history",
    "gridItemConfig": {
        "sizex": 2,
        "sizey": 1
    },
    "widget": {
        "insights-widget": {
            "type": {
                "bar": {
                    "dataDirection": "horizontal",
                    "columnsAsLabels": true,
                    "labelFirstColumn": false,
                    "legendPosition": "none",
                    "xAxisMin": "2022-12-05T17:41",
                    "xAxisMax": "2022-12-06T17:41",
                    "dataType": "point"
                }
            },
            "queryFile": "Users/<user>/applquery.sql"
        }
    }
}
```

## Create a dashboard to analyze Azure resources

The charts made with Insights widget are the building blocks of a dashboard. Here we'll build a dashboard that monitors and analyzes Azure resources. To begin, create charts with these four queries using `Doughnut` for *Storage accounts with versioning disabled*, `Line` for *Disk metric read ops daily*, `Table` for *List of unattached disks* and `Pie` for *Virtual machine count per region*. Then, click `Create Insight` to save their JSON configurations.

### Storage accounts with versioning disabled

```
select
  count(name)
from
  azure_storage_account
where
  not blob_versioning_enabled;
  ```

### Disk metric read ops daily

```
select
  name,
  timestamp,
  minimum,
  maximum,
  average,
  sample_count
from
  azure_compute_disk_metric_read_ops_daily
order by
  timestamp;
  ```

### List of unattached disks

```
select
  name,
  disk_state,
  sku_tier,
  time_created,
  encryption_type,
  network_access_policy
from
  azure_compute_disk
where
  disk_state = 'Unattached';
  ```
### Virtual machine count per region

```
select
  region,
  count(name)
from
  azure_compute_virtual_machine
group by
  region;
  ```

To build, open `Dashboard` under `Preferences: Open User Settings` and click `Edit in settings.json` for  `Dashboard > Database: Widgets`. Paste the insight JSON configuration for the visuals under `dashboard.database.widgets`. To note here, Data Studio requires the queries to be saved in a `.sql` file with the `queryFile:` configuration property pointing at its path.

<div style={{"marginTop":"1em", "marginBottom":"1em", "width":"50%"}}>
<img src="/images/docs/cloud/azure-datastudio-widget-config.png" />
</div>

Save the user settings and right-click on the database name and select `Manage` to display the Dashboard.
