##  Connect to Steampipe Cloud from Navicat

[Navicat](https://navicat.com/en/) is a database management and design tool. It connects to many databases, including Postgres, and enables users to explore, query, and visualize data.

Steampipe provides a single interface to all your cloud, code, logs and more. Because it's built on Postgres, Steampipe provides an endpoint that any Postgres-compatible client -- including Navicat -- can connect to.

The [Connect](/docs/cloud/integrations/overview) tab for your workspace provides the details you need to connect Navicat to Steampipe Cloud.

##  Connect to Steampipe CLI from Navicat

You can also connect Navicat to [Steampipe CLI](https://steampipe.io/downloads). To do that, run `steampipe service start --show-password` and use the displayed connection details.

```
Steampipe service is running:

Database:

  Host(s):            localhost, 127.0.0.1, 192.168.29.204
  Port:               9193
  Database:           steampipe
  User:               steampipe
  Password:           99**_****_**8c
  Connection string:  postgres://steampipe:99**_****_**8c@localhost:9193/steampipe
  ```

## Getting started

[Navicat](https://navicat.com/en/download/navicat-for-postgresql) is available to use on your desktop through a free trial or by making a paid purchase.

To create a new connection, first click on `Connection` and select `PostgreSQL`. Enter the connection details, enable SSL,click `Test Connection` to verify, then click `Save`.

Once you're connected to Steampipe Cloud, the PostgreSQL Explorer can access the connection's tables in your workspace.

</div>

We use the AWS plugin and select the `aws_ec2_instance_availability` table. Navicat displays the table's schema and previews the data. You can drag the columns to organize the data, and export the data to a [variety of formats](https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/cli/check#output-formats).

## Create a chart with custom query

Here we will focus on creating a chart to analyze the versioning status of S3 Buckets in the AWS account. To begin, click the `New Query` block, paste this query in the command palette, then click `Run`.

```
select
  name,
  region,
  account_id,
  versioning_enabled
from
  aws_s3_bucket
```

Navicat then previews the data in a table form. Now click on the `Create Chart` icon to open the visualize data form and select Type as `Pie chart`. Update the Group field with `versioning_enabled` and Value with `name` to display the chart with the data.
