## Connect to Steampipe Cloud from HeidiSQL

[HeidiSQL](https://www.heidisql.com/) is a database tool to query, edit and manage your databases.

Steampipe provides a single interface to all your cloud, code, logs and more. Because it's built on Postgres, Steampipe provides an endpoint that any Postgres-compatible client -- including HeidiSQL -- can connect to.

The [Connect](/docs/cloud/integrations/overview) tab for your workspace provides the details you need to connect HeidiSQL to Steampipe Cloud.

</div>

Once the connection to Steampipe cloud is established and tested, you can access the tables provided by the Steampipe plugins, run queries and build reports.

You can also connect HeidiSQL to [Steampipe CLI](https://steampipe.io/downloads). To do that, run `steampipe service start --show-password` and use the displayed connection details.

```
Steampipe service is running:

Database:

  Host(s):            localhost, 127.0.0.1, 192.168.29.204
  Port:               9193
  Database:           steampipe
  User:               steampipe
  Password:           99**_****_**8c
  Connection string:  postgres://steampipe:99**_****_**8c@localhost:9193/steampipe
  ```

## Getting started

[HeidiSQL](https://www.heidisql.com/download.php) is a program that runs on Windows. In this example we will create a Steampipe Cloud connection with HeidiSQL and query the top stories from Hacker News.

To establish a new connection click on `New` at the bottom left, select PostgreSQL(TCP/IP) and enter the Steampipe Cloud connection details, check the `Use SSL` box under the SSL tab and click `Open`.

</div>

Once you've connected to Steampipe Cloud, you can access the Hacker News plugin and its tables from the Database explorer.

<div style={{"marginTop":"1em", "marginBottom":"1em", "width":"50%"}}>

</div>

Here we select the `hackernews_top` table. HeidiSQL displays the table's schema and previews the returned data. You can drag the columns to rearrange the data, then save to CSV, HTML, XML, LaTeX, Wiki markup or PHP.

## Run your first custom query

HeidiSQL provides a SQL query editor that you may use to write a custom query. For example, we can use this query in the editor to fetch the list of top stories with most comments.

```
select
  *
from
  hackernews_top
order by
  descendants desc
  ```
