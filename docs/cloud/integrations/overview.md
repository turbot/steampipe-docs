# Integrations

Your Steampipe workspace database has a public IP address, allowing you to connect to it from anywhere using the Steampipe CLI or other standard tools and utilities that support Postgres.

The **Connect** tab for your workspace will provide the Postgres connection string.  Note that the connection string includes your password.  It is masked in the web console display, but you can click **Copy** to copy it so you can paste it into your tool's configuration screen.
