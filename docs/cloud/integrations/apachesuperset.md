##  Connect to Steampipe Cloud from Apache Superset

[Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/) is a data exploration and visualization platform that connects to many databases, including Postgres, and enables users to explore, query, and visualize data.

Steampipe provides a single interface to all your cloud, code, logs and more. Because it's built on Postgres, Steampipe provides an endpoint that any Postgres-compatible client -- including Apache Superset -- can connect to.

The [Connect](/docs/cloud/integrations/overview) tab for your workspace provides the details you need to connect Apache Superset to Steampipe Cloud.

##  Connect to Steampipe CLI from Apache Superset

You can also connect Apache Superset to [Steampipe CLI](https://steampipe.io/downloads). To do that, run `steampipe service start --show-password` and use the displayed connection details.

```
Steampipe service is running:

Database:

  Host(s):            localhost, 127.0.0.1, 192.168.29.204
  Port:               9193
  Database:           steampipe
  User:               steampipe
  Password:           99**_****_**8c
  Connection string:  postgres://steampipe:99**_****_**8c@localhost:9193/steampipe
  ```

## Getting started

[Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/) is a free to use open-source application that runs in a container, or on the desktop. Here we run it locally using docker compose.

With Apache Superset up and running, open a browser to `http://localhost:8080/`. Click on `Database Connections` under settings on the top right corner, then click `+Database` and select `PostgreSQL`. Enter the connection details, toggle the SSL mode to `Require` and click connect.

</div>

Alternatively, you can connect to the database using the `SQLALCHEMY URI` option and use the connection string.

</div>

Now add a `Dataset` which is a representation of a table you want exposed for querying. To do that click on `+Dataset` from the Datasets tab and update the database, schema and table details. Here we add a dataset using the `azure_compute_disk` table to list the Azure compute disks.

</div>

To create the table, select the `azure_compute_disk` dataset, set the `QUERY MODE` to `RAW RECORDS`, update the columns to be displayed and click `CREATE CHART`. Superset will then preview the data.

</div>

## Create charts with custom queries.

You can augment your SQL queries using Superset's `SQL Lab` (under the SQL tab) and visualize them with a suite of charts. To try that, click `SQL Lab` and paste this SQL that returns the number of compute disks per region.

```
select
  region,
  count(name)
from
  azure_compute_disk
group by
  region;
  ```

Once the result is returned, click `CREATE CHART` and select `PIE CHART`. Now update the region and count columns into the dimensions field, set the metric field to aggregate `MAX` count and click `UPDATE CHART`. Custom queries can also be saved as datasets.

</div>

## Create a dashboard to analyze resources

Charts that display data are the building blocks of Apache Superset dashboards. We'll focus here on a creating a dashboard that monitors the Azure VMs and disks. To begin, click `+Dashboard` from the Dashboards tab, and click `+Create a New Chart`. Then create datasets and charts with `azure_compute_virtual_machine_metric_cpu_utilization_hourly` and `azure_compute_disk_metric_read_ops_daily` tables. Finally paste these queries to create dataset charts for VMs with disks not encrypted by customer-managed key, and for unattached disks.

```
select
  count(disk.encryption_type)
from
  azure_compute_disk as disk
  join azure_compute_virtual_machine as vm on disk.name = vm.os_disk_name
where
  not disk.encryption_type = 'EncryptionAtRestWithCustomerKey'
  ```

```
select
  name,
  disk_state,
  sku_tier,
  time_created,
  encryption_type,
  network_access_policy
from
  azure_compute_disk
where
  disk_state = 'Unattached';
  ```

Superset provides a variety of chart types. Here we use `Bar Chart` for azure_compute_virtual_machine_metric_cpu_utilization_hourly, `Funnel Chart` for azure_compute_disk_metric_read_ops_daily, `Table` for list of unattached disks and `Gauge Chart` for VMs with disks not encrypted by customer managed key. The dashboard can also be saved as an image by simply clicking on `Download as image` from the dashboard menu.

## Summary

With Apache Superset and Steampipe Cloud you can:

- View tables in your Steampipe Cloud workspace

- Write custom queries for those tables

- Create interactive dashboards driven by your tables and queries
