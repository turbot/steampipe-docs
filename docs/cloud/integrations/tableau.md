# Connecting to Your Workspace from Tableau

[Tableau](https://www.tableau.com) is a visual analytics platform transforming the way we use data to solve problemsâ€”empowering people and organizations to make the most of their data.

The [Connect](http://localhost:3000/docs/cloud/connecting/overview#connecting-to-your-workspace) tab for your workspace provides the details you need to connect to Tableau.

See [this Tableau page](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/postgres/) for instructions on connecting to Postgres. If you are using Tableau Desktop, you will need an additional Tableau driver described [here](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/examples_postgresql.htm)

Once you've tested the connection to Steampipe Cloud, you can browse the tables provided by your Steampipe plugins, run queries, and build dashboards.

Here's Tableau Desktop browsing the tables provided by the AWS plugin.
