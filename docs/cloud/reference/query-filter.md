# Steampipe Cloud Query Filters

Many Steampipe Cloud APIs support a filter syntax that allows you to search and filter lists using SQL-like grammar.  APIs that support this capability will have a `where` parameter that allows you to pass in a `where` clause for the filter:

```bash
export STEAMPIPE_CLOUD_TOKEN=spt_c6rnjt8afakemj4gha10_svpnmxqfaketokenad431k

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${STEAMPIPE_CLOUD_TOKEN}" \
https://cloud.steampipe.io/api/latest/user/johnsmyth/workspace/myworkspace/snapshot?where="dashboard_name='aws_insights.dashboard.aws_account_report'" 
```


The console also supports this query syntax:

<br />


Note that the query filter is parsed and processed by the Steampipe API, not passed to a backend database - there's no need to worry about SQL injection.  In fact, the schema of the query reflects the API output, and is entirely abstracted from the backend storage implementation.

# Syntax

The `where` argument syntax supports a subset of the postgres `where` clause syntax. 

You can do simple equality operations:
```sql
dashboard_title = 'AWS Account Report'
```

Or inequalities (using `!=` or `<>`):
```sql
visibility != 'workspace'
```
```sql
visibility <> 'workspace'
```

You can use `like` (or `not like`) to do wildcard matching
```sql
dashboard_name like 'aws_insights%'
```
```sql
dashboard_name not like '%.benchmark.%'
```

Or `ilike` for case-insensitive wildcard matching
```sql
dashboard_name ilike 'aws_insights%'
```

You can use standard comparison operators (`>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`) \:

```sql
dashboard_title > 'S'
```
```sql
created_at < '2022-08-10T18:32:09Z'
```


You can even use `now()` and `interval` to do relative date/time filters:
```sql
created_at > now() - interval '26 hr'
```
```sql
created_at > now() - interval '2 days'
```
```sql
created_at > now() - interval '1 week'
```
```sql
created_at > now() - interval '1 month'
```


<!--
Boolean
```sql 
!!! We dont have any Boolean fields currently
```
<-->

You can use `in()` to compare against multiple values:
```sql
dashboard_title in ('AWS Account Report', 'Shared Access')
```

Or `not in()` to do the inverse:
```sql
dashboard_title not in ('AWS Account Report', 'Shared Access')
```

You can check for null:
```sql
tags is null
```

Or  not null values:
```sql
inputs is not null
```

You can use json arrow operators for json fields, with the usual string, numeric, and boolean operators:
```sql
inputs ->> 'input.vpc_id' = 'vpc-11111111'
```
```sql
tags ->> 'Name' is null
```
```sql
inputs ->> 'volume_arn' like '%:123456789012:%'
```

You can even do complex compound statements with `and` and  `or`:
```sql
inputs ->> 'input.vpc_id' = 'vpc-11111111' and dashboard_title = 'AWS VPC Detail'
```
```sql
(dashboard_title = 'Shared Access' or dashboard_title = 'AWS Account Report') and created_at > '2022-08-10T18:32:09Z' 
```

# Queryable Columns
The queryable columns come from the API results, but not all columns can be used in a `where` filter - Each API has specific columns allowed for querying. 

For example, the `snapshot` API returns:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "snap_cbpvpdmv4vji3f000000_3v1gvdufu9eez5cwpjgy8u80k",
      "identity_id": "u_01234567890123456789",
      "workspace_id": "w_01234567890123456789",
      "state": "available",
      "visibility": "workspace",
      "dashboard_name": "aws_insights.dashboard.aws_account_report",
      "dashboard_title": "AWS Account Report",
      "schema_version": "20220614",
      "inputs": null,
      "tags": null,
      "created_at": "2022-08-10T18:45:10Z",
      "created_by_id": "u_01234567890123456789",
      "created_by": {
        "id": "u_01234567890123456789",
        "handle": "johnsmyth",
        "display_name": "johnsmyth",
        "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6843140?v=4",
        "status": "accepted",
        "version_id": 11,
        "created_at": "2021-11-23T18:20:15Z",
        "updated_at": "2022-08-10T14:06:10Z"
      },
      "version_id": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

But the `snapshot` API only allows you to filter on:
  - `created_at`
  - `dashboard_name`
  - `dashboard_title`
  - `id`
  - `inputs`
  - `tags`
  - `title`
  - `visibility`
  - `expires_at`
