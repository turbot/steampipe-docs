# Viewing Dashboards

Once you've add a connection and installed one or more mods into your workspace, the [Dashboards](dashboard/overview) (including [Benchmarks](check/overview)) will become available for you to run in the **Dashboards** tab. You can browse the list, or use the powerful search to filter by name / tag etc.

# Saving & Sharing Snapshots

Steampipe Cloud allows you to save and share dashboard **snapshots**.
A snapshot is a saved view of a dashboard at a point in time with a given set of inputs and variables.


To take a snapshot, click the camera icon at the top of the dashboard after the dashboard is fully loaded (the button will be disabled until the dashboard has finished loading).

Alternately, you can click the **Share** button to take a snapshot and share a link with others.  You can set the visibility of the snapshot to
restrict access to only those with access to your workspace, or share it such that anyone on the internet with the link can view it.

# Browsing Snapshots

From any dashboard, you can browse and navigate its snapshot history.  Click the **View** button at the top of the dashboard to display the menu.  You can select a date from the calendar and the snapshots from that date are listed beneath.  Click any snapshot to open it.

Clicking **All matching snapshots** at the bottom of the menu will take you to the snapshot page (you can also navigate to this page by clicking the **snapshots** button at the top of the **dashboards** pane).


# Managing Snapshots

You can browse and search all snapshots in your workspace. From the main dashboard page, click the **Snapshots** button at the top of the page.

The Snapshots page allows you to manage all snapshots in your workspace.  The **Query** box allows you to enter a query to search and filter the snapshot list.
