# Steampipe Docs

The [Steampipe Documentation](https://steampipe.io/docs) is open source! You can give us feedback and request for changes by submitting issues and pull requests in this repository.

## Format & Structure

Docs are written in markdown format and are located in `docs` folder. The entry-point document will contain front-matter with `slug: /`.

Each document requires the following frontmatter, adjust the values as per your requirement:

```yaml
id: learn
title: Learn Steampipe
sidebar_label: Learn Steampipe
```

We support up to 2 levels of docs, e.g.:

- `docs/foo`
- `docs/foo/bar`

For your docs to appear in the sidebar, you need to edit `docs/sidebar.json`. This is an array of sidebar entries, which are either stings matching the path of the required document, or a category to nest the docs down 1 level.

Any images required by docs must be placed in `/images/docs/...` and must be referenced by the tag `<img src="/images/docs/..." />`.
